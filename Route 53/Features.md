# DNS:
     DNS (Domain Name System) is the “phonebook of the internet.”
It translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.190.14) that computers use to locate and communicate with each other.

# Key functions of DNS
    -Domain → IP translation
    -Load distribution (via round-robin, etc.)
    -Caching to speed up lookups
    -Hierarchy of DNS servers: Root → TLD (e.g., .com) → Authoritative servers

# Route 53:
     A highly available, scalable, AWS-managed DNS service that adds health checks, traffic routing, domain registration, and deep AWS integration—going beyond basic DNS.
