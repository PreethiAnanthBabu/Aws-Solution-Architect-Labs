# Elastic Container Registry:
     Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images. You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull, and manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.
# Components of ECR:
     -Registry
     -Authorization Token
     -Repository
     -Repository Policy 
     -Images
