# Cloud computing:
     Is the on-demand delivery of AWS computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing, instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers.In AWS, this means you use AWS data centers to run your applications rather than building your own infrastructure.
